# Rock Paper Scissors Trainer
Given a new basic understanding of arrays, state, views, images, text, and more, I was asked to put them together: My challenge is to make a brain training game from scratch that challenges players to win or lose at rock, paper, scissors.

So, very roughly:
- Each turn of the game the app will randomly pick either rock, paper, or scissors.
- Each turn the app will alternate between prompting the player to win or lose.
- The player must then tap the correct move to win or lose the game.
- If they are correct they score a point; otherwise they lose a point.
- The game ends after 10 questions, at which point their score is shown.
- So, if the app chose “Rock” and “Win” the player would need to choose “Paper”, but if the app chose “Rock” and “Lose” the player would need to choose “Scissors”.
